# System_identification
During my first year of master degree at Politecnico di Torino, I attended a course colled 'Estimation, filtering and system identificatio'. One of the main argument of this course was the identification of linear dynamic system from input to output measurements by using ARX,ARMAX and OE models. Moreover, in order to evaluate the model structure selection and validationn I used some criteria such as whiteness test and residual analysis, FPE, AIC and MDL. I carried the identification using MATLAB.
